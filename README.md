**Follow the [TL;DR](#tldr) to get started right away!**

## [Description](#description)

This repository contains a practical guide designed to help users, especially those without a technical background, utilize [OpenAI's Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) for speech transcription and translation. We will utilize [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to speed up the process via their **free GPU**. The guide includes a step-by-step walkthrough on setting up and executing transcription commands with various options. It's tailored to make the process of speech-to-text conversion accessible and straightforward.

## [How to Use the Notebook](#how-to-use-the-notebook)

The tutorial assumes you have an audio file (mp3, flac, wav, etc.) ready to use in the demonstration for translation/trascription. If you don't have one handy, feel free to download the sample audio file provided  for [transcription](AllStar.mp3) or [translation](Cupid_Fifty_Fifty_Korean_Version.mp3). 

 1. **Accessing the Notebook**: Open the [Whisper_Tutorial.ipynb](Whisper_Tutorial.ipynb) file and look for the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the file. You may also click here

    </a>

 2. **Making a Copy in Colab**: Once the notebook is open in Google Colab, 
    1. Go to the **'File'** menu in the Colab toolbar. 
    2. Select **'Save a copy in Drive'** from the dropdown menu. This will create a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive, allowing you to run and edit it without affecting the original version.
 3. **Running the Notebook**: Follow the instructions in the notebook to transcribe/translate your audio file!

## [TL;DR](#tldr)

Assuming you are using audio file for [transcription](AllStar.mp3) and [translation](Cupid_Fifty_Fifty_Korean_Version) (or a file with the same name): 

1. Open the [Whisper_Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/keatonkraiger/Whisper-Transcription-Tutorial/blob/main/Whisper_Tutorial.ipynb) in Colab.
2. Enable the GPU (Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU). 
3. Upload the audio files to Colab (click the folder icon on the left, then click the upload icon).
4. Run all the cells in the notebook (Runtime > Run all).
5. Download the zip folders with the transcription files (right-click `transcriptions.zip` and `translations.zip` in the file explorer and select "Download").
6. Replace the audio file names in the commands below with your own audio file names to generate custom transcriptions/translations.

## [Useful Commands](#commands)

### Create Caption File
To create files in the SubRip format (SRT) which is frequently used in video editing software/YouTube:
```bash
whisper audio_file.mp3 --task transcribe --output-format srt # english transcription

whisper audio_file.mp3 --task translate --output-format srt --language Mandarin # Chinese translation
```

### Create Transcript File
To **translate** the audio file to a different language:
```bash
whisper audio_file.mp3 --task translate --output-format srt --language es # Spanish
```

### Options for Whisper (such as languages)
You can find call Whisper's help output to get information such as supported languages by running:
```bash
whisper --help
```

### Word Level Captions

If you want caption segment to be a 3 words max opposed to sentences:
```bash
 whisper audio_file.mp3 --task translate --language Korean --output_format srt --word_timestamps True --max_words_per_line 3 # for Korean translation
 
 whisper audio_file.mp3 --task transcribe --output_format srt --word_timestamps True --max_words_per_line 3 # for transcription
```
