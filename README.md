## Description

This repository contains a practical guide designed to help users, especially those without a technical background, utilize [OpenAI's Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) for speech transcription and translation. We will utilize [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to speed up the process via their **free GPU**. The guide includes a step-by-step walkthrough on setting up and executing transcription commands with various options. It's tailored to make the process of speech-to-text conversion accessible and straightforward.

## How to Use the Notebook

The tutorial assumes you have an audio file (mp3, flac, wav, etc.) ready to use in the demonstration. If you don't have one handy, feel free to use the sample audio file provided in this repo [here](AllStar.mp3). 

 1. **Accessing the Notebook**: Open the [Whisper_Tutorial.ipynb](Whisper_Tutorial.ipynb) file and look for the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the file. You may also click here

 1. **Making a Copy in Colab**: Once the notebook is open in Google Colab, go to the 'File' menu in the Colab toolbar. Select 'Save a copy in Drive' from the dropdown menu. This will create a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive, allowing you to run and edit it without affecting the original version.
 2. **Running the Notebook**: Follow the instructions in the notebook to transcribe your audio file!

This tutorial also comes with an accompanying supplementary video tutorial that quickly goes over the main points of transcription. See the notebook for more information.
